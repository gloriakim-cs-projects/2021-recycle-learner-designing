# Recycle Learner

## Executive Summary

**<SUMMARY>**

Recycling Learner is a platform where people can classify recyclable items using machine-learning and are tuomaticaly informed about recycling process of that specific item in order to increase the importance and awarenss of recycling. The platform includes the following features:
- Automatically recycle the captured image of recyclable/non-recyclable items
- Host a classroom environment-setting to meet virtually and share knowledge (including chat box and hopefully image and goal sharing)
- Have a daily/weekly/monthly competition with classmates
- Show recycling and donation centers near users
- Show recycling and upcycling information
- Find local recycling events
 
**<NEED OF RECYCLING AWARENESS>**
  
While there are products to automatically recycle trash, there is almost no product that targets individuals to instantly classify the recyclable materials and learn the specific process of recycling to increase the awareness of recycling.
 
**<NEEDS OF VIRTUAL EDUCATION>**
  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid enhancement of virtual technology creates a wider range of educational methods in virtual environment. In addition, allowing anyone to access anytime and anywhere, the virtual educational methods can give people a greater educational opportunity that can potentially open a door for educational equality for those who cannot easily attend a school (e.g., no school around them, people with disabilities, rising cost for higher education). The virtual environment can also serve as cognitive stimulus because it can detect users from the real world to some extent and thus ease the effort perceived during exercise and provide a cognitive input for both distraction and goal achievement. Thus, the virtual environments increase the effectiveness in terms of motivating people to have more intense and repetitive activities for a longer period.

## Target Customers

1) Schools
2) Recycling Centers
3) Environmental Activities (or anyone who just want to recycle better!)
4) Governments (or anyone who wants to access statistics on recycling behaviors)

## What Makes Difference with Other Products

While there are products that use machine-learning to improve recycling behaviors, we found no product that uses a classroom-setting with a machine-learning based recycling classifier in order to improve both the learning side and the actual recycling behavior. We believe this platform will provide a better learning for anyone who is conscious about environments, specifically in terms of recycling.

## Statistics & Impact

**<RECYCLING STATISTICS ON DIFFERENT LOCATIONS/CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS>**

- The number of recycled items in total
- The number of trashed items in total
- The number of recycled items for each category
- The number of trashed items for each category
-  The percentage difference of recycling behavior compared to last week/month

**<SOCIAL IMPACT>**

- Goals to reach every day/week

## Used Data

**<MACHINE LEARNING MODEL>**
  
- 100+ pictures of recyclable/non-recyclable materials for over 300 classification

## Assumption

We assume that it will take less than 1 second to classify one image.
We assume that it will have less than 5% of error (We are hoping to make it less than 1% of error).

## Expected Timeframe

Immediate (<2 months)
We would appreciate to receive some feedback from data scientists (or anyone experts in machine-learning and/or statistics) for our algorithm to optimize our classification process.

## Potential to Expand the Project

**<RECYCLING PARTS>**
  
While it may take additional efforts and resources to reflect different recycling rules depends on locations, we see the potential to expand this platform globally.

**<MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS (IF POSSIBLE)>**

If we happen to find a better machine-learning algorithm to apply for image classification, we believe this algorithm can be applied to computer vision in a number of fields.

## Potential Customers

Anyone who is conscious about the environments will be our potential market opportunity. As the U.S. president Joe Biden said that he will be more environmentally-conscious, we expect to see more environmental friendly consumers in future.

## OpenVINO

We will use OpenVINO to improve the optimization of machine-learning algorithm that is used to classify the recyclable/non-recyclable items.

## TCS IP

We plan to use an agile approach to develop this platform as well as there is someone to give us constant feedback for each phase. We would also like to know more about TCS IP to apply it to our project.

## Prototype

In addition to the prototype listed above, we plan to include classroom features as follows (hopefully all of them): (1) chat box, (2) sharing screen, (3) writing on screen, (4) muting, (5) speaking, (6) listening, and (7) tracking goals among classmates (daily/weekly/monthly).
